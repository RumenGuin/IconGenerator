# IconGenerator
It is easy to use.
Choose an image that you want to be your app icon. 
Choose a folder where you want to save your all image sizes.
It will create a folder AppIcon.appiconset in the folder you chose and make all image sizes in that AppIcon.appiconset folder.
If your chosen folder has AppIcon.appiconset folder already, it will overwrite with current image and will not create a new AppIcon.appiconset folder.
After generating all the image sizes, simply tap on the image and it will take you to AppIcon.appiconset folder.
You can drag that folder to your own project and you will get all size of image required for your app.
